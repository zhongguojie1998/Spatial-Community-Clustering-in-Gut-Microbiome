# MaPS-seq protocol

This document contains the MaPS-seq protocol (as published in Sheth et al., Nature Biotechnology 2019, internal version v3.0). The published manuscript methods section represents the most accurate protocol, but here I've tried to make things easier to follow and provide as much rationale as possible why certain decisions were made in designing different aspects of the method.

I would highly recommend trying a control mixing experiment (e.g. as performed in the paper in Fig. 1 with clusters containing different bacterial species) before trying a biological sample for the first time. There are many complex steps to this protocol and so this is a good validation that everything is working before advancing to actual samples. 

Questions and comments welcome, on the github or by email (sheth dot u dot ravi at gmail dot com).

### Microfluidic device fabrication
#### Casting of devices
The wafer was ordered from FlowJEM with ~40 Î¼m feature height, and is ready to cast. There are two microfluidic devices, one for barcoded bead generation (single port input) and one for bead and cluster co-encapsulation (dual port input).
- Weigh 10:1 (50g/5g) of Sylgard 184.
- Mix for 5 minutes in sterile pipette box with P1000 tip
- Degas for 30 minutes under house vacuum to remove all bubbles
- Take large weighing boat and carefully place wafer on it.
- Pour PDMS solution on wafer, and degas again for 5-10 min or until bubbles are gone.
- Place in 80C oven for 1 hour.
- Allow to cool to room temperature.
- Carefully remove wafer and store in petri dish.
- Cut out PDMS chips, and cut holes with 1mm biopsy punch from feature side.
- Clean off feature side with scotch tape, and clean the surface of a precleaned glass slide.
- Plasma treat PDMS device and slide
	- Turn on plasma cleaner
	- Turn on vacuum for 1 min with port closed
	- Switch port to low gas input for 1 minute
	- Turn on "HIGH" for 40 seconds. Strong plasma glow should be seen.
- Remove device and quickly place feature side down on precleaned glass slide.
- Place in 80C oven for 30min.

#### Aquapel treatment of microfluidic chips
Chips need to be treated when first constructed. This is best performed in parallel. Note that this protocol is adopted from [Mazutis et al., Nat. Protocols 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2013.046).
- Cut pad that aquapel solution is embedded within. Score ampule with diamond scribe, and place ampule in 50mL conical and break the ampule within the tube.  
- Pipette aquapel solution in 10mL syringe.
- Inject solution into microfludic device. Leave solution in channels for 30s, and flush with air (pressurized air) at all three fluidic ports.
- Flush device with FC-40, and flush with air (pressurized air) again at all three fluidic ports.
- Bake chip at 80C for 10 minutes.

### Barcoded bead construction
Barcoded Hydrogel construction consists of three extension steps to create barcoded hydrogel beads containing >880K unique barcodes. Construction largely follows [Zilionis et al., Nature Protocols 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.154) with minor modifications. It's advisable to make a few batches of beads at a time (typically we make 3-4 at once).

	- Prepare 300uL of an acrylamide master mix:
		- 162uL nuclease free water
		- 30uL TBSET buffer
		- 75uL Acry/Bis stock 4X
		- 24uL acry-pc-pe1 primer (250uM stock; 20uM final)
		- 9uL 10% APS (wt/vol)
	- Vortex, microfuge and place in 1mL tube pre-filled with 300uL HFE7500 and prime as above, with syringe tip facing up due to HFE7500 priming. Protect tubing from light with black sheath.
	- Connect tubing to droplet formation device and flow at 5uL for acrylamide master mix and 50uL for carrier. Allow flow to stabilize and watch on microscope with red filter.
	- Once flow is stabilized (~1 minute) collect droplets with tubing in 2mL tube pre-filled with 300uL mineral oil. Ensure that droplets are 20um in diameter, which is desired for 25um input channel width in the encapsulation chip.
	- Replace with new tube after 30 minutes.
	- When finished (i.e. either acrylamide or carrier runs out) remove output tube and drain, and stop flow.
	- Clean chip quickly with water to prevent in-chip polymerization which could clog the chip.
	- Place two tubes in 65C incubator overnight, protected from light.
- Cleanup of beads:
	- The next day, ensure that beads are polymerized by pipetting on microscope field.
	- Remove mineral oil and carrier oil phases from the tubes, and pool both tubes. Add 500uL TBSET on top.
	- Add 1mL of 20% PFO in HFE7500, vortex, and centrifuge at max RPM for 30s. Remove bottom 20% part of PFO phase and centrifuge again.
	- Remove The bottom 20% of PFO phase and add 1mL of 1% Span-80 in hexane. Vortex and centrifuge at max RPM for 30s, and remove hexane layer.
	- Repeat hexane wash again.
	- Add 1mL TBSET and vortex. Centrifuge at max RPM for 1m, and remove hexane layer by keeping tip at air-water interface to remove trace hexane.
	- Repeat TBSET wash three times.
	- Pass beads through 40um cell strainer using TBSET to pass through beads.
	- Recover beads and save in amber tube at 4C for up to 6 months. Measure diameter which should be 25-30um (due to swelling) and ensure uniformity.

#### Barcoding of hydrogel beads via primer extension (rounds 1-3)
- Barcoding reaction
	- Add 1mL WB to approximately 20,000,000 beads, vortex, and spin down at max RPM for 1 min. Repeat wash for a total of three times.
	- Remove supernatant, and adjust volume to exactly 730uL with WB.

	- Thaw primer plate for the round (pe1, pe2 or pe3). Centrifuge for 1 min to collect condensate.
	- Place primer plate, bead plate (tap down to ensure mix is at bottom) and destination plate (96 well Eppendorf Twin-tec) on Beckman liquid handler with 2X P50 barrier tips. For bead tips, specify to the liquid handler the remaining tips.
	- Using liquid handler, mix the beads and distribute 9.3uL to the destination plate. Then distribute 4.8uL of primer to each well.
	- Re-seal primer plate with new seal and mark use on side of plate. Seal destination plate and spin down plate.
	- Incubate in PCR machine: 85C 2min, 60C 120min. Start timer for 22min.
	- Prepare reaction mix: 595uL water, 70uL 10X isothermal amplification buffer, 35uL Bst 2.0 Polymerase. Place 80uL in each well of the second column of the 96 V-well plate from before.
	- After 20 min of incubation, take plate out and remove seal.
	- Place reaction mix plate (tap down to ensure mix is at bottom), destination plate, P50 barrier tips on liquid handler. Transfer 5.4uL of the reaction mix to each well.
	- Seal destination plate and spin down plate.
	- Incubate back on PCR machine for 60m. Cool plates on ice and remove seal.
	- Remove from PCR machine, and place destination plate, 10mL STOP25 buffer in 20mL reservoir, and P50 barrier tips on liquid handler. Add 15uL STOP25, mix and place in recovery reservoir for each well. Wash each well with 20uL of STOP25 and place in recovery reservoir.

- Perform STOP10, DENATURE, NEUTRALIZE washes as above.
- After NEUTRALIZE washes, filter beads through 40 micron filter as above.
- Wash recovered beads three times in TET as above. Save in amber tube at 4C.

### Sample fixation
Samples are fixed in methacarn to avoid damage to mucosal structures that may result with other fixatives such as formaldehyde.
- Acquire sample (e.g. intestinal tissue); at this time it is likely on interest to save samples for other assays (e.g. metagenomic sequencing, bacterial culture)
- Immediately place sample for MaPS-seq in methacarn solution (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, 10% acetic acid).
- Fix the sample at room temperature for between 24 to 48 hours.
- Replace the sample in 70% ethanol after this period for storage up to 1 month (longer periods may be possible, but have not been investigated)

### Sample embedding
The sample is then embedded with an degradable acrylamide matrix which preserves spatial structure and contains a reverse 16S amplification primer. 

##### Preparation of  stock solutions
- Monomer 2X concentrate (store -20C indefinitely).

| name | amt to add | final conc in gel (w/w) |
|:----:|:----------:|:---------------:|
|Acrylamide|1g|10%|
|N,Nâ²-Bis(acryloyl)cystamine|0.04g|0.4%|
|10X PBS filter sterilized|1.0mL|1x|
|nuclease-free water|3.0mL|n/a|

- Other stock solutions (store -20C, remake once every 2 weeks)
	- APS (10% w/w; 0.1g/1mL ddH20), final  0.2%
	- TEMED  (10% v/v stock, 0.1mL+0.9mL ddH20), final 0.2%
	- 4HT  (0.5% w/w stock, 0.005g/1mL ddH20), final 0.01%

##### Embedding of sample
```diff
- IMPORTANT: ensure that the photocleavable primer is protected from light
- IMPORTANT: once polymerized, the gel is sensitive to reducing conditions (due to BAC crosslinker).
- Store samples/particles at 4C in TET and protect from any reagents that may contain reducing agents.
```
- Remove sample from fixative, cut into parts no larger than 3x3mm with a sterile razor, and wash in PBS, and let sit for 5 min.
- Remove PBS, and incubate sample in permeabilization buffer (1x PBS, 0.1% Triton-X 100) for 5 min.  
- Prepare an embedding stock solution in the following order on ice, with mixing between each step. Make sure to keep all reagents on ice.
	- 4uL reverse primer (250uM stock), 5uM final
	- 100uL monomer concentrate
	- 84uL water
	- 4uL 4HT
	- 4uL TEMED
	- 4uL APS
- Remove sample from PBS and dab dry with a sterile kim wipe to remove excess PBS.
- Place the sample in an PCR tube on ice. Place enough solution to fully embed the sample and allow to sit on ice for 5 minutes. Remove excess solution and replace; this increases concentration of embedding solution to replace any PBS from the sample. Allow to embed for 1 hour to overnight allow for full perfusion; cover the tube with foil to prevent premature cleavage of the reverse primer.
	- Note: An alternative initator is VA-044, a thermally activated initiator which can be used to initiate polymerization in the same manner. This can be used, at a final concentration of 0.5% w/w in the embedding solution and 4HT, TEMED and APS can be omitted and replaced with water.
- Remove any excess liquid by pipetting out, but ensure that the sample is still fully submerged under liquid.
- Open the tube top, cycle into a anaerobic incubator (O2 inhibits polymerization reaction) and allow to polymerize at 37C for >3 hours; cover the tube with foil to prevent premature cleavage of the reverse primer or photobleaching of the fluorophore.
- Ensure that sample is fully polymerized. Extract the embedded sample from the tube, and trim excess polymer matrix with a sterile razor.
- Wash 2 times in PBS and 1 times in TET (10mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 0.1% Tween-20) and store in TET at 4C for short term storage or -20C for long term storage.

### Fracturing
The embedded sample is then broken into small particles using cryofracturing.
- Place sample in stainless steel microvial (Biospec 2007). Freeze sample on LN2 ~2 min (without submerging vial) and shake vial to ensure that particle can move freely and is not adhered to wall.
- Add a single 6.35mm stainless steel bead on top (Biospec 11079635ss). Seal the tube with a silicone rubber plug cap (Biospec 2008).
- Place vial back in liquid nitrogen for at least 2 minutes.
- Quickly transfer to a bead beater (Biospec 112011) and beat for 10s. Note that beating time dictates the size distribution of particles; depending on desired particle size beating time can be adjusted to increase yield in a desired range.
- Resuspend particles in PBS, vortex, and transfer to a sterile tube. Wash 2 times in PBS. Note that during wash steps, particles should be centrifuged at max RPM for 10s to ensure full sedimentation. Metal residue may color the particles a grey color, but this will not affect downstream steps.

### Lysis of cells within embedded clusters
Particles are then treated with lysozyme and proteinase K to lyse cells.

##### Lysozyme treatment
- Resuspend particles in 500uL lysis buffer (Tris-HCl pH 8 10mM, EDTA 1mM, NaCl 100mM)
- Add 1uL lysozyme (37.5KU/uL stock) to sample (final concentration 75U/uL)
- Incubate at 37C for 1 hour with shaking; ensure cap stopper is added.

##### Proteinase K treatment
- Resuspend particles in 500uL digestion buffer (30mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, EDTA 1mM, 0.5% Triton X-100, 800mM guanidine HCl).
- Add 1uL of proteinase K (50ug/uL stock) (final concentration 0.1ug/uL).
- Incubate at 65C for 15 min with shaking; ensure that cap stopper is added.
- Incubate at 95C for 5 min to inactivate proteinase K; ensure that cap stopper is added.
- Wash particles in 500uL TET buffer 3x times and store at 4C for short term storage.

### Size selection
Nylon mesh filters are utilized to size-select fractured acrylamide particles. The protocol is modular to meshes of different sizes.

##### Preparation of nylon mesh filters
- Sterilize a 1/2" hole punch (Amazon) and workspace.
- Take nylon mesh filters of size 7um, 15um (Component Supply Company) and punch. Prepare multiple filters for multiple experiments in advance.
- Place in a plastic bag for long-term storage

##### Size selection of acrylamide particles
- Filter sample through a 40um cell culture filter (Falcon), and save flow-through, to remove large particles.
- Clean and sterilize Swinnex 13mm filter holders, gasket O-rings, punched nylon mesh filters via UV sterilization.
- Place each filters in a Swinnex filter holder with gasket O-ring.
- NOTE: during filtration, if there is high pressure the filter is clogged and filtering needs to be repeated with less clusters to ensure proper filtration.
- Start with the 15um filter. Place 2 filters in assembly.
	- Take sample and resuspend in 1mL of TET. Connect a 3mL syringe to the filter. Pipette the 1mL into the filter, and carefully push liquid through the filter applying minimal pressure to the syringe. Collect sample in a sterile 1.5mL tube and repeat this filtering step twice for a total of three times. Set flow-through aside; this fraction contains particles smaller than 15um.
	- Aspirate 1mL of TET, flow back and forth through the filter assembly and discard. 
	- Aspirate 1mL of TET, flow back and forth through the filter assembly. Pull liquid in the syringe and save in a microfuge tube; this contains particles greater than 15um.
- Switch filters to the 7um filter. Place 2 filters in assembly.
	- Connect a 3mL syringe to the filter. Pipette the 1mL <15um sample into the filter, and carefully push liquid through the filter applying minimal pressure to the syringe. Collect sample in a sterile 1.5mL tube and repeat this filtering step twice for a total of three times. Save flow-through; this  contains particles smaller than 7um.
	- Aspirate 1mL of TET, flow back and forth through the filter assembly and discard. 
	- Aspirate 1mL of TET, flow back and forth through the filter assembly. Pull liquid in the syringe and save in a microfuge tube; this contains particles 7-15um.
- Quantify numbers and store in amber tube for short term storage at 4C. Sizes of particles can also be quantified by staining with 1X SYBR Green I and quantification on a microscope. Particles are not stable for long time periods likely due to slow degradation of the gel.

### Bead and cluster co-encapsulation

##### Equipment preparation
- We utilize three Harvard Apparatus Pump 11 Elite syringe pumps and a Nikon Ti2 inverted microscope to observe droplet formation and flow.

##### Encapsulation protocol

###### General preparation

- Wash beads twice with WB
- Wash beads twice with Bead Buffer (10mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20, 50mM KCl, 10mM DTT)
- Repeat centrifugation and remove last remains of supernatant with fine-tip gel tip.
- Using empty 1mL syringe connected to tubing, aspirate approximately 5uL of packed beads (approximately the length of a razor blade) and then approximately 10cm of air.
- Remaining beads can be washed twice in TET and returned to stock tube.
- Cut tubing right where beads start. Backfill a syringe with 500uL HFE7500, remove bubbles and prime with 25 gauge needle.

- Quantify cell-clusters via hemacytometer, immediately before encapsulation.
- Remove approximately 2,500 cell-clusters and wash three times in WB (~50 clusters/uL). NOTE: centrifugation steps must be done for at least 1 minute at max RPM to ensure full sedimentation of cell-clusters.
- Centrifuge down cell-clusters and remove all supernatant. Repeat centrifugation and remove last remains of supernatant with fine-tip gel tip.
- Prepare encapsulation master mix (45uL), and resuspend cell-clusters in the master mix:
	- 25uL NEB Next Q5 2x Master Mix
	- 4uL NycoPrep (60% w/v Nycodenz)
	- 5uL 10%w/v Pluronic 127

- Prime beads, flowing at 1uL/min, encapsulation mix at 0.3uL/min and oil at 0.3uL/min
- Close pack beads, flowing beads at 0.3uL/min, encapsulation mix at 0.3uL/min and oil at 2uL/min until close packing is observed.
- Start encapsulation by adjusting encapsulation mix to 2.7uL/min.
- Once proper and stable droplet formation (faint flickers at droplet junction) is observed, add capture tubing and collect droplets into a Axygen Maxymum recovery tube filled with 50uL mineral oil and 10uL of 30% EA surfactant.
- Once reagents are finished, remove capture tubing and drain into capture tube. Then turn off syringe pumps. Extra beads may be washed with TET twice and returned to stock vial. 
- Wash microfluidic chip with water.
- Emulsion may be investigated on a microscope to quantify bead and cluster loading effeciencies

- Ensure that droplets are intact after cycling. It is recommended to remove 1uL of droplets from 1 tube per sample type and observe co-encapsulation statistics.
- Remove as much of EA/oil underneath tube and mineral oil above tube.
- Add 20uL of PFO in HFE75000 to the droplet phase. Vortex for 5s, and centrifuge down on a microfuge.
- Extract as much of the aqueous phase as possible and pass through spin column (Costar 0.45um) in Lo Bind tube. Save spin column.

### MaPS-seq quality control
##### Construction of synthetic community particles
To test the ability of MaPS-seq to provide data on single particles, we generated synthetic bacterial communities, and co-encapsulated these communities.
- Prepare cells for two synthetic communities:
	- One synthetic community is a single strain (e.g. E. coli or S. pasteurii) 
	- Second synthetic community is homogenized fecal pellets. Bead beat 5 mouse fecal pellets in 1mL PBS with 0.1mm glass beads for 1 min to homogenize. Pass through 40um filter (Falcon).
- Resuspend cells to equal cell concentrations or pellet sizes. 
- Samples are processed as above with minor modification. Fixation proceeds as per the protocol. Embed cell pellet as above in equal volume of of embedding solution to cell pellet size. Fracturing, preparation and filtering proceeds as above. 
- Note, cells can be embedded in solution without 4HT to speed polymerization (as embedding is not required given it is a cell suspension) but APS must be added at the last possible moment to prevent premature polymerization.

### Barcoded Bead Quality Control

##### Quantification of extension efficiency via FISH
To assess the efficiency of primer extension, as well ExoI cleanup, we utilize fluorescence in situ hybridization with Cy5 labeled probes targeted to the Illumina adapter (i.e. unextended ssDNA product) and the 515f primer (fully extended ssDNA product). The ratio of intensity observed with the 515f probe to the Illumina probe reflects the extension efficiency of the construction protocol.
- Perform all steps for beads before ExoI cleanup and after ExoI cleanup, as well as for PE1 and 515f probe (4 total)
- Resuspend 1uL packed beads in 18.2uL PROBE buffer. Add 0.8uL of 250uM probe (either PE1 or 515f) such that the final concentration is 10uM.
- Allow to hybridize at RT for 30 min.
- Wash beads 3 times with 500uL of PROBE buffer. Resuspend in 20uL PROBE and place on slide with coverslip.
- Record average intensity per bead using an epifluorescence microscope.

##### Validation of photorelease of primers from bead and particles - Bioanalzyer
To assess UV exposure-dependent release of primers from barcoded beads and particles, we utilize the Agilent Bioanlyzer HS DNA assay kit to detect low concentrations of ssDNA product.
- Resuspend ~5,000 beads in 10uL nuclease-free water. Make two aliquots.
- Expose one aliquot to UV light (BlackRay Xenon 365nm UV) for 10 minutes on ice. Place the other aliquot on ice and protect from ambient light.
- Spin down aliquots and remove ~5uL of supernatant.
- Load 1uL of supernatant and follow manufacturer instructions for the Agilent Bioanylyzer HS DNA kit.

## 16S FISH studies

To confirm findings from the MaPS-seq technique, we also perform 16S FISH. We base our FISH protocol largely on commonly used FISH protocols, and previously validated probes (see the manuscript for FISH primer details). Note that it is imperative to treat slides extremely gently at all times to prevent bacteria from washing off the section.

### FISH protocol
- Paraffin embed sample and obtain 4 um lumenal sections 
- Deparaffinize slides by placing in xylene for 10m
- Rehydrate through an ethanol gradient (95% Et0H 10m, 90% EtOH 10min; wash under running DI water)
    - Do not let dry out during this processs
- Incubate with FISH probes diluted to 10ng/uL in hybridization buffer (0.9M NaCl, 20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.01% SDS, 10% formadide) at 47C for 4hr in closed humid environment.
    - resuspend probes to 500ng/uL in 10mM Tris pH7.5
    - ~5-10 uL needed per reaction, for 50uL master mix:
        - 1uL 1M TrisHCl 7.5
        - 9uL 5M NaCl
        - 5uL formamide
        - 0.1uL 10% SDS
        - 32uL water
        - 1uL each probe
	  - Add 5-10 uL of probe mix, cover with coverslip and put in 50mL conical with cotton ball.
- Make wash buffer (0.9M NaCl, 20mM TrisHCl pH7.5) and prewarm at 47C. Wash off hybridization with pipette/wash buffer and incubate with wash buffer  at 47C for 10m
- Wash 3x in PBS
- Incubate with 10ug/mL DAPI (1:100 stock) in PBS for 5min at 4C
- Wash 3x in PBS
- Mount with vectashield (~10uL)
